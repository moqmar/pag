# pag - a password generator

Generates **random strings**, gibberish (**pronounceable passwords**), or "*correct-horse-battery-staple*" **passphrases in English or German**.

## web app

The probably user-friendliest password generator out there - just enter the address, press enter and Ctrl+C the password to your clipboard.

There are no prerequisites - just put it into a directory served by any webserver (which should support [range requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests) for the generators `D` and `E`). Or use my public instance:

#### âžœ https://pag.momar.io

Tip of the ~~day~~ decade: press the keys 1-4 to select a strength, and A-E to select a generator. 

## command line

A simple command-line interface for password generation. Requires [node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org).

```bash
$ npm install -g pag-cli
$ pag --help
$ pag        # medium gibberish
$ pag a3     # strong random
$ pag a3 -c  # copy to clipboard (linux only, requires xclip)
```

## is it secure?

**Quick answer: probably, and the default (medium gibberish) passwords are safe enough for everyday accounts.**

Passwords are completely generated client-side using the [window.crypto](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/crypto) API, the connection to the public instance is secured using HTTPS, there are no requests to third-party servers, and I don't collect any information about you (not even your IP address).

Entropy should be similar accross the generator types for the same strength, although it would be great if someone could do the math here - I just calculated it roughly.
  
There is one thing that might be an issue for you: when using the generators `D` and `E`, the word lists are requested from the server in chunks of 1024 KB (the full lists are a couple of Megabytes in size, I don't want to make the page slow or consume lots of bandwidth), so the server could theoretically see *how many passwords you generated and which words could be used in your passwords*. I personally don't collect or use any of that information from the public instance, but please at least make sure that you're on an HTTPS connection.  
**If this is an issue for you, please use the command line app, or append [#nochunks](https://pag.mo-mar.de/#nochunks) to the URL. This will require up to 30 MB to be downloaded though!**

Fun fact: the German passphrases are more secure because there are more German words.
